1. **Identifies all connected companies** for the individual.
2. **Gathers publicly available information** from online sources (e.g., news articles, databases, social media).
3. **Performs sentiment analysis** on the collected data, classifying sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
4. **Detects negative news** related to fraud, scams, lawsuits, or allegations.
5. **Outputs results** in a structured format (JSON or CSV) with:
    - Company Name
    - Sentiment Classification (positive, negative, neutral)
    - Flag for Negative News (fraud, scam, lawsuit, etc.)
